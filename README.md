# Weather Forecast web application

A responsive web application in which allows users to access current and future weather information for a selected location. User-friendly interface with image elements to make it easy to understand the weather forecast.

### Languages and tools used:
- Typescript
- ReactJS
- Styled components
- React Select
- Dayjs
- Vitejs

#### All data was fetched from an open-source API: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

Users are able to select a city and filter the weather information that they are interested to know, such as:

- Temperature (current and hourly)
- Lowest and highest temperatures (current day and daily)
- Sunrise and sunset time
- Precipitation 
- Windspeed
- Snowfall
- Cloud cover
- Humidity

#### This project is part of my learning journey. Please, feel free to make any suggestions for further improvements.

Thank you,
