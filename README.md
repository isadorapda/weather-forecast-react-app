All data was fetched from an open-source API: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

Users are able to select a city and filter weather information that they are interested to know, such as:

- temperature (current and hourly)
- lowest and highest temperatures (current day and daily)
- sunrise and sunset time
- precipitation 
- windspeed
- snowfall
- cloud cover
